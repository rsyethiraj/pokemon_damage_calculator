# pokemon_damage_calculator

The plan for this repository is to develop an app that can compute Pokemon damage calculations for different generations. I plan to write the backend in C++ with an integration with an SQL database. 

The Database will contain tables for general pokemon, as well as for moves and specific pokemon. I might add functionality for items as well in the future. I intend on adding functionality to the frontend to add pokemon/moves to the database.
